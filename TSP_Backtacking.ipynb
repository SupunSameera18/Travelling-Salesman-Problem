    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is an implementation of the traveling salesmanperson problem (TSP) using a backtracking algorithm. TSP is a well-known problem in computer science where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and then returns to the starting city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code defines a function called tsp that takes as input a graph, a list of visited nodes, the current position, the number of nodes in the graph, the count of visited nodes, and the current cost. If the function has visited all the nodes and there is an edge from the current node back to the starting node, it appends the total cost of the traversal to a global list called answer and returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not all the nodes have been visited, the function loops through each of the adjacent nodes of the current node. If the node has not been visited and there is an edge between the current node and that node, the function marks the node as visited, calls itself with the updated information, and then marks the node as unvisited. This process is repeated until all possible paths have been explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all the paths have been explored, the minimum value in the answer list is printed, which is the minimum cost Hamiltonian cycle for the given graph."
